<h1>Flashcard App UI/UX Design:</h1>

I created an easy-to-use interface for a flashcard app, making it simple and enjoyable for users to study.
The design focused on making the app visually appealing and easy to navigate, helping users learn more effectively.
I listened to user feedback and ran tests to make sure the design was intuitive and improved it based on what users said.

<H2>SQLite Data Management Integration:</H2>

I set up a database system using SQLite to organize and handle data in the flashcard app.
Designed the database structure to efficiently store flashcard content, track user progress, and manage other important data.
I made sure that the database worked smoothly and quickly by optimizing how it searched for information and performed tasks.

<H2>Randomized Study Mode Feature Development:</H2>

I created a feature that randomly selects flashcards for users to study, making learning more engaging.
Developed algorithms that choose flashcards randomly to encourage users to actively remember information.
I made the feature customizable, so users can adjust settings to match their preferences for studying.

<H2>Spaced Repetition Algorithm Implementation:</H2>

Integrated a spaced repetition algorithm into the app to help users memorize information more effectively.
Developed algorithms that schedule when users should review flashcards based on the spaced repetition principle.
Made the app adapt the timing of reviews based on how well users remembered information and their feedback.

<H2>Version Control with Git for Collaborative Development:</H2>

I used Git to manage changes to the app's code and to work with others on developing it.
Established rules for how changes were made and reviewed to keep the development process organized.
Took advantage of Git's features like pull requests and code reviews to maintain the quality of the code and add new features smoothly.
