<h1>Flashcard App UI/UX Design:</h1>

I created an easy-to-use interface for a flashcard app, making it simple and enjoyable for users to study.

The design focused on making the app visually appealing and easy to navigate, helping users learn more effectively.

I listened to user feedback and ran tests to makee sure the design was intuitive and improved it based on what users said.

<H2>SQLite Data Management Integration:</H2>

<p2>I set up a database system using SQLite to organize and handle data in thhe flashcard app.</p2>

<p2>Designed the database structure to efficiently store flashcard content, track user progress, and manage other important data.</p2>

<p2>I made sure that the database worked smoothly and quickly by optimizing how it searched for information and performed tasks.</p2>

<H2>Randomized Study Mode Feature Development:</H2>

<p2>I created a feature that randomly selects flashcards for users to study, making learning more engaging.</p2>
<p2> Github= amreeta97....   pass= Jugnu@9798 </p2>

<p2>Developed algorithms that choose flashcards randomly to encourage users to actively remember information.</p2>

<p2>I made the feature customizable, so users can adjust settings to match their preferences for studying.</p2>

<H2>Spaced Repetition Algorithm Implementation:</H2>

<p2>Integrated a spaced repetition algorithm into the app to help users memorize information more effectively.</p2>

<p2>Developed algorithms that schedule when users should review flashcards based on the spaced repetition principle.</p2>

<p2>Made the app adapt the timing of reviews based on how well users remembered information and their feedback.</p2>

<H2>Version Control with Git for Collaborative Development:</H2>

<p2>I used Git to manage changes to the app's code and to work with others on developing it.</p2>

<p2>Established rules for how changes were made and reviewed to keep the development process organized.</p2>

<p2>Took advantage of Git's features like pull requests and code reviews to maintain the quality of the code and add new features smoothly.</p2>
